# Turning-Gait

This repository contains supplemental data (excel format) for the article: "The use of turning tasks in clinical gait analysis for children with cerebral palsy". Dixon PC, Stebbins J, Theologis T, Zavatsky AB. Clinical Biomechanics. doi: 10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2015.10.010

There are three main worksheets (Ground Reaction Forces, Joint Kinematics, and Joint Kinetics) in which normative turning data (spin turns)
for the typically developing (TD) group are found. These data were used in the present study to quantify changes during turning in 
children with cerebral palsy.

The "Subject Anthropometrics" worksheet contains anthropometric data (age, weight, height, leg-length, and sex) for all TD subjects. The 
workbook also lists which data are available for each subject (due to experimental set-up constraints not all data were acquired for each 
subject over the entire turning cycle).

The "Summary Graphs" worksheet presents average data (pooled over all available subjects) for each gait variable listed in the three main
worksheets.

The spin turn data contained in the "Ground Reaction Forces" and "Joint Kinetics" worksheets are presented in "Ground reaction forces and 
lower-limb joint kinetics of turning gait in typically developing children. Dixon PC, Stebbins J, Theologis T, and Zavatsky AB. 2014 
J Biomech 47(15) 3726-33". Here, ground reaction forces were not rotated in the turning coordinate system. Rather, they are presented in the force plate coordinate system. Data related to the step turn and straight walking conditions are also available in the cited publication, but not shown here.

The spin turn data contained in the "Joint Kinematics" worksheet is an updated version (increased number of subjects) of those found in 
"Spatio-temporal parameters and lower-limb kinematics of turning gait in typically developing children. Dixon PC, Stebbins J, Theologis T,
and Zavatsky AB. 2013. Gait and Posture 38(4) 870-5". Data related to the step turn and straight walking conditions are also available in 
the cited publication, but not shown here.
